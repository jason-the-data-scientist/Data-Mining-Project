Data-Mining-Project

This project was done with me and 2 other students testing various statistical learning techniques on data that has no background. There were two parts.
1. Use create a supervised model.
2. Create a unsupervised model.
Both models were on different datasets and no descriptions was provided. Our team ended up using a random forest model for supervised learning because it provided the best test error.
